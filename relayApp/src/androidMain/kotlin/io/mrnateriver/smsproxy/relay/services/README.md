# Clean Architecture

The structure of services follows the Clean Architecture principles:

- **/usecases**: Corresponds to the "Use Cases" layer and contains business logic. Doesn't depend on
  any other layer. Most of the services are defined as implementations of their own
  interfaces (contracts) for the sake of automatic mocking in tests.

- **/data**: Corresponds to the "Interface Adapters" layer and contains implementations of DAOs and
  remote APIs. Depends on the Use Cases layer to map DAOs to corresponding models. Autogenerated
  HTTP API client would be in the same directory, if it weren't generated as a separate module.

- **/framework**: Corresponds to the outermost "Frameworks" layer. Acts as a glue layer between use
  cases and Android APIs.

Note that this module doesn't have any Entities - they are defined in the `shared` module. Use Cases
define a few models, which are basically just DTOs between UI and Use Cases layers.
